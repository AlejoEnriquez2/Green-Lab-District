In order to complete the experiment, the videoconference tools that are going to be used are both in Electron desktop apps and Browser version of it. 
On the Browser we have Skype, Slack and Discord at its latest online version. And for the Electron desktop apps Skype (version 8.104.0.207), Slack (version 4.34.120) and Discord (version 6.2.0-33-Generic) installed in the Ubuntu 22.04 laptop whos technical specifications are listed in table *. 
The execution of the experiment will be done by the laptop which joins a videoconference meeting and starts sharing video, audio and video and audio, video and screen sharing. This will be executed multiple times with the different combinations using the browser Chromium (version 117.0.5938.92) and Electron desktop having similar setup for its afterwards comparision. 
During this videoconference meetings, Experiment Runner (version 0.0.2) and Wireshark (version 3.6.2-2) will be measuring the network traffic and hardware usage of the different setups, this information will be saved in a csv file for its processment and analysis. 
This same process will be executed for Slack, Discord and Skype. 
In order to get similar input of data on every execution we will set a virtual camera with a prepared video that will be used as default input for all the iterations, similar for the audio with the microphone, we will use the same audio for all the experiment iterations, this way we assure more comparables results. 
With Experiment Runner we will measure the hardware usage and for the network usage we will use Wireshark to capture the sent and received packages.
The videoconferences are set up automatically using a script that will start or connect to the meeting, then set the initial values of microphone, camera and screen sharing depending on the iteration, after the defined time the meeting will end and the data will be captured and stored, then a new meeting will start with different setup to do the same process.
